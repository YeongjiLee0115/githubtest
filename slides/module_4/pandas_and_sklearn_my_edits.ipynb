        "# Exploring `pandas` and `scikit-learn`\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we'll explore some more advanced features of two popular Python libraries:\n",
        "- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): **P**ytho**N** **DA**ta **S**cience Library is essentially a wrapper for [numpy](https://numpy.org/) that provides really useful tools for bookkeeping and manipulating data.  If you're familiar with [`data.frame`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/data.frame) objects or the [`plyr`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/plyr/versions/1.8.6) or [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) libraries in R, you'll see lots of similarities to Pandas `DataFrame` objects and how to work with them.  As a historical note, Pandas was inspired by R dataframes and R's \"[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)\" libraries for data science.\n",
        "- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): a machine learning package for Python that implements many of the most widely used algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.  Scikit-learn is built on top of [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "Before digging into either of these libraries, here are some useful orienting guidelines that might help you to think about what each library does:\n",
        "- Numpy's main feature is that it introduces the `array` datatype.  Arrays are like matrices or tensors-- *n*-dimensional tables of numbers.From an implementation standpoint, arrays are just like nested lists, where the outer-most level corresponds to the first dimension, the second outer-most level corresponds to the second dimension, and so on (where the inner-most level corresponds to the last dimension).  Because arrays are built on lists, you can often pass nested lists directly into numpy functions (as though they were arrays) and they'll be treated just like arrays.  Once you've organized your data into one or more arrays (or array-like objects), numpy allows you to apply a wide variety of linear algebra operations to the data.  Numpy is also written in efficient C code, which means that you can work effectively with very large datasets.\n",
        "- Pandas's main feature is the introduction of the `DataFrame` datatype.  From an implementation standpoint, DataFrames are like Python dictionaries where one key, called \"`values`\" points to the data (stored as a 2D numpy array); a second key, called \"`index`\" points to another numpy array that contains labels for the rows; and a third key, called \"`columns`\" that points to a numpy array containing labels for the columns.  Once you've created a DataFrame, you can mostly treat it just like a 2D numpy array-- many numpy functions \"just work\" on DataFrames (e.g., it'll usually work fine if you just pass DataFrames directly to numpy methods that are expecting arrays).\n",
        "- Scikit-learn really provides two general tools:\n",
        "  - First, the library includes implementations of a wide variety of algorithms for doing the most widely used machine learning tasks.  This typically requires your data to be organized into numpy arrays and/or pandas DataFrames and or lists.  \n",
        "  - Second, the library includes a general framework for *organizing* code for implementing machine learning algorithms.  This is arguably the most powerful and furthest-reaching contribution of scikit-learn.  For example, nearly every model in scikit-learn is implemented as a Python class with a `fit` method (which takes in a training dataset and trains or applies the given model) and a `transform` method (which takes in potentially new data and projects it through the given model).  The common structure across models means that it's relatively straightforward to implement new models or features that will then play nicely with the other functionality in the library.\n",
        "    - Additional related libraries extend the functionality of scikit-learn even further.  For example, [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) adds image processing algorithms; [scikit-network](https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) adds graph theory algorithms; [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/) adds some additional optimization algorithms; and so on.\n",
        "    - There is some redundancy between scikit-learn and other popular libraries.  For example, scikit-learn includes some deep learning models and tools.  However, most of these implementations are less efficient and less flexible than libraries like [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) that are focused specifically on deep learning, rather than on \"machine learning\" in general.\n",
        "    - A reasonable rule of thumb might be to implement basic ideas using scikit-learn as a way to get things \"up and running\" on a test dataset or application.  But then if you want to scale things up to a much larger dataset you may want to port things over to another library."

        "The overarching goals are to:\n",
        "- Increase familiarity with some advanced features of Pandas and Scikit-learn\n",
        "- Learn how to quickly read an API\n",
        "- Learn how to Google examples code snippets and adapt them to your needs\n",

        "1. Make sure you understand the problem:\n",
        "  - What does the *input* or *data* look like?\n",
        "  - What does the *output* or *solution* look like?\n",

        "  - What libraries will you need?\n",
        "  - What's the syntax for using the function(s)?  (Hint: look up the library's API and then search for those functions!)\n",
        "  - What format does your dataset need to be in?  How can you wrangle it into that format?\n",
        "3. Create (or find!) a simple example of how to use the function(s)\n",
        "  - Good places to start your search: Google, Stack overflow, online tutorials or demos, GitHub repositories for relevant projects\n",
        "  - Don't worry (initially) about starting with the dataset you'll be applying your analysis to-- it may be easier to create a fake dataset (or download another existing dataset) that is already in the proper format.  You can use this as your \"dev\" dataset.\n",
        "4. Wrangle your dataset into the format you'll need it in.  This may involve:\n",

        "  - Modifying existing values\n",
        "  - Filling in missing values\n",
        "  - Adding rows or columns, potentially based on values in other rows/columns\n",
        "  - Changing data types (e.g., converting strings to integers, etc.)\n",
        "    - It's worth spot-checking your dataset to make sure you *know* the datatype for each entry\n",
        "  - Make sure that values are consistent-- e.g., standardize capitalization, formats of dates, spelling, etc.  The `unique` function (in numpy or pandas) can be really useful here.\n",
        "5. Apply your function to your dataset:\n",
        "  - Start by copying the syntax you used in your \"dev\" dataset\n",
        "  - Then adjust or adapt any arguments or syntax to reflect your \"target\" (\"real\") dataset of interest\n",
        "6. Examine the result:\n",
        "  - Is the result the expected size?\n",
        "  - Do the rows and columns look right?\n",
        "  - Spot check a few entries (use `head` and `tail`, and then also select out a few rows/columns at random to check them).  More data implies that you should do more spot checks.  And if you have a small enough dataset (or if the dataset is important enough) you may want to manually check over the entire result.\n",

If you're working in a group, pick one person from your group to share their screen, and (roughly) plan out who will talk.  Aim for a quick debriefing-- try to take no more than 5 minutes (and ideally closer to 2ish minutes) to explain (a) your problem and (b) your solution."
